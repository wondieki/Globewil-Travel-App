        <h2>Turning Rejection into Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Wilder, and before founding GlobeWil Travel Consultancy, I faced a reality many travelers can relate to but few openly talk about—visa denials.
          Specifically, I was denied a USA visa <strong>six times</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time, the rejection came down to a combination of things: inadequate preparation, unclear documentation, not knowing how to answer interview questions,
          and simply not understanding what consular officers were really looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember walking out of the embassy disappointed, not just because of the rejection itself, but because I knew my intentions were genuine,
          yet I didn’t know how to prove that on paper or in conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I stopped guessing and started researching, learning, and seeking guidance. I studied immigration requirements, analyzed patterns,
          and practiced my interview responses. On my seventh attempt, with proper documentation, confident answers, and a well-prepared case—I was finally approved.
        </p>
        <p>
          That victory moment sparked something bigger in me.

        <h2>Why I Started GlobeWil Travel Consultancy</h2>
        <p>
          After experiencing firsthand how confusing and emotionally draining the visa process can be, I realized I wasn't alone.
          So many people are denied—not because they don’t qualify, but because they don’t know how to present their case effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why I founded GlobeWil Travel Consultancy—to bridge that gap.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>A Traveler Who Gets It</h2>
        <p>
          I haven’t just studied visa processes—I’ve lived them. To date, I’ve traveled to <strong>15 countries</strong>, including USA, Germany,
          the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Andorra, Spain, South Afica and Tanzania. Every trip has taught me something new, and I plan to explore even more in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          That real-world experience helps me bring practical insights, not just theory. I understand both the paperwork and the emotions that come with international travel—
          excitement, anxiety, hope, and sometimes frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          At GlobeWil, we don’t offer cookie-cutter solutions. We offer personalized support rooted in experience, empathy, and a deep understanding of what it takes to make your travel dreams a reality.
